1. Layers implemented:
    a) Test data:
        In Exercise2 test data is filled inside method annotated as DataProvider.

    b) Test logic realisations:
        In both exercises test logic is implemented in one method.

    c) Test launching:
        Is done by TestNG framework.
        Tests, that should be launched are implemented in testng.xml file.

    d) Logging
        Logging is done only to standard output.

    e) Services:
        Inside test logic realisation chrome browser is opened.
        Tested site is launched from outside.

    f) Configurations:
        testng.xml provides login data.
        URLs are hardcoded.

2. Layers missed:
    a) Reports
    b) Logging to files
    c) No utilities are used
    d) Configuration (as URL) is not in separate layer

3. Possible solution improvements:
    a) Logging:
        Each test could be logged to separate file.
        For better understanding test data and screenshots could be added to logs.
    b) Test data:
        All test data could be implemented in separate files. DataProvider methods should only read and
        parse this files to avoid recompiling tests after changing or adding test data.
    c) Configurations:
        URL of tested service could be implemented in testng.xml file or another separate file to avoid
        recompiling of tests if site/service migrates to another URL.
